# lecture 20/10
virus <- c(10, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80)
death <- c(100, 240, 310, 470, 580, 690)
#plot function to crate a graph 
#data.frame function create a tab
data.frame(virus,death)
# we can assign the function with this variables to a determinate letter/name ike this(so that it's easier to use)

d <- dataframe(virus,death)
d
# aes is important for other functions that works for 
ggplot(d, aes(x=virus, y=death))
# like this we didnt expalined the geometry of our points-> geom_points()
ggplot(d, aes(x=virus, y=death)) + geom_point()
# inside the comas of the last function we can change some details, like colorss ex:
# remember quotes"" for colors
ggplot(d, aes(x=virus, y=death)) + geom_point(color="coral", size=3)
let's change something in how it looks
ggplot(d, aes(x=virus, y=death)) + geom_line(color=coral, size=3)
#and we can unite them, like this we get a graph with lines and points:
ggplot(d, aes(x=virus, y=death)) + geom_point(color="coral", size=3) + geom_line(color="brown1", size=1)
#lecture 21/10
# we downloaded datas and put in the lab folder, so they are outside R, let's use the function to use them, using a function (setwd()) to explain R where to find them:
# do not open datas  with excel, it could create problems
setwd("C:/lab/")
#now R knows where to search, let's import the datas with the function (read.table()), but we need to be careful about arguments, let's try it without arguments, but assigned to a name in this case "covid"
covid <- read.table("covid_agg.csv")
#but like this R consider the first line like datas, not like header
HEADER- can be true or false(by default it's considered FALSE), in our case it's true because first line of datas is a header so we need to explicit that is true
covid <- read.table("covid_agg.csv", header=T)
covid #this shows all the datas in a tab
summary(covid) # basic stats about datas
# now we can use ggplot
ggplot(covid, aes(x=lon, y=lat)) + geom_point(col="brown1", size=2)
#now we can variate the size of points based on number of cases
ggplot(covid, aes(x=lon, y=lat, size=cases)) + geom_point(col="brown1")
